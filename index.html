<Title>ASSESSMENT 1: MY PROFILE</Title>
<body>


<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to the profile of Peter McKendrick. In this space, we will dive into some<br/>
personal aspects: From a glimpse of his background and interests to the perspective of IT and<br/>
that perfect job. With new online profiling techniques, there is a greater understanding of the<br/>
personality, learning styles, and psychometrics that surround Peter.</p>
<p>A project at the end will demonstrate developed skills, experience, and knowledge in<br/>
the IT field. Showing first-hand how to anticipate outcomes and ‘thinking on your toes’ will truly<br/>
shine. Previous studies/experiences in the automotive world will also add to the twist.</p>
<p>Hi! My name is Peter McKendrick. My student ID is S3930703 and you can reach me on<br/>
s3930703@student.rmit.edu.au. I am Māori decent with 2 Brothers and 1 Sister (small family – I<br/>
know!). Very happily married to Melissa with 2 curious, but cheeky young boys.</p>
<p>After completing year 12, I went on to an apprenticeship in the Automotive Industry.<br/>
Most of the theory has been completed through Queensland TAFE. Working in large<br/>
workshops/corporations has many great benefits – for me, it was further training to become<br/>
Master Diagnostic Technician (highest level in auto trade). A few years later, I was allowed to<br/>
upskill to Dual Trade – Auto Electrician.</p>
<p>During my apprenticeship, I used to ride BMX professionally (Street and Halfpipe). In<br/>
one competition, which was my last, I had a very bad accident. Basically (read further if you<br/>
dare) my left leg was pointing in a direction it shouldn’t….. yup! I still ride to this day, though<br/>
just with the family and with NO extreme tricks.</p>
<p>I love IoT, Smart things, and Networking. Recently, I have been researching a lot into<br/>
programming and Raspberry Pi. During my studies in Auto Electrical, we had learned about<br/>
Gates – How they work and create operations using Gates. My first program was to turn a light<br/>
bulb on and off, using a series of transistors representing a CPU. I had such a big smile! My new<br/>
home (in the build process) is full of IoT, with its very own home lab. I am so excited to see it<br/>
finished</p>
<p>Everything starts with an idea on paper. Putting that idea into reality is how I made it to<br/>
RMIT. Requiring further studies for my career in IT (Idea), I had researched a lot of universities.<br/>
It was the testimonies on RMIT that caught my eye. Seeing the success of previous students and<br/>
the excitement of their learning has motivated me.</p>
<p>I have no experience in any university studies at all! What I expect from this, is to be<br/>
challenged and so uncomfortable - I have a very steep learning curve and strive under pressure.<br/>
It’s not just IT, but everything that university has. Essay’s, Assignments, Team/Group<br/>
presentations. All my training/study prior has been TAFE or in-class tests. To me, it’s not just IT.<br/>
It’s also the university.</p>

<h1>Profile</h1>
• An Assertive Protagonist is the conclusion from the Myers-Briggs test.<br/>
• A Visual Learning Style is the conclusion from Education Planner .org<br/>
• Creativity is a “Work in Progress” from Mindtools.com<br/>
<p>There is a sense of familiarity after completing all online tests above. Only a few comments<br/>
have missed the mark completely, though very surprised about the remainder as I have not<br/>
completed tests like these before.</p>
<p>Completely understanding the assertiveness of a protagonist is my likely behavior in<br/>
groups/teams. My career in the automotive industry has demonstrated leadership along with<br/>
encouragement for others to excel, along with compassion</p>
<p>As a mature aged student, I have understood boundaries when it comes to team members’<br/>
willingness ‘step up’ or even participate. My focus has always entailed enjoyable learning<br/>
environments</p>

<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
<h2>Overview<h2><h3>The Portable Digital 3DWheel Alignment.</h3>
<p>There are many types of portable wheel alignment analogue/digital readers currently in<br/>
the market that utilize multiple devices that include a small display screen on each reader. Most<br/>
of these devices show only a few settings of adjustments and operate one by one. The Portable<br/>
Digital 3D Wheel Alignment will have each digital reader work in conjunction with each other<br/>
on a 3D landscape (X, Y and Z axis), whilst utilizing a tablet device to show many fields of<br/>
views for more superior control. An extra sensor situated on the steering wheel assists with<br/>
straight-ahead steering adjustments.</p>
<p>Ease to store countless information in i/pads, tablets, and even cloud services regarding<br/>
multiple makes, models, and procedures. The versatility of the digital readers was originally<br/>
aimed at racecars on track days, though expansion into local workshops can save owners tens of<br/>
thousands of dollars in equipment. On-the-go adjustments are very possible right in the owners’<br/>
driveway with a user-friendly GUI.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The Automotive Industry always looks to innovation, especially when it involves costs,<br/>
versatility, and availability. Wheel alignments are required in all fields in the Automotive<br/>
Industry. The average workshop 3D wheel alignment machine can cost up to $10,000. More<br/>
professional 3D wheel alignment machines can cost in excess of $45,000. Mobile mechanics<br/>
have to recommend other workshops that defeat the meaning of the Mobile Mechanic.</p>
<p>Attaching sensors to wheels will remain the same, the difference will be how the sensors<br/>
are read. Technology, mainly memory, has increased in capacity and decreased in size. Resulting<br/>
in a more compact, mobile, and more cost-effective device, compared to its bulkier predecessors.<br/>
Gyroscope, accelerometers, and compass sensors have also become compact and more affordable.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There are a few components involved with the Portable Digital 3D Wheel Alignment, and<br/>
within each Digital Reader, there are several components that make up a working Digital Reader.</p>
<p>• Digital Readers. Four (4) units – One (1) per wheel. Incl One (1) rechargeable<br/>
docking station. Extra digital readers are sold separately.</p>
<p>• Wheel Adapter Bracket. Four (4) units – One (1) per Digital Reader. Extras are<br/>
sold separately.</p>
• Steering Wheel Digital Reader.<br/>
• Steering Wheel Adapter Bracket.<br/>
• Steering Wheel Lock<br/>
• Stop/Brake Pedal Brace<br/>
• Tablet Device – Includes charger, Wi-Fi capabilities, and installed GUI (plug and play).<br/>
<p>Each Digital Reader contains a Wi-Fi, Gyroscope, Accelerometer, and Compass<br/>
sensor which are all programable. Powered by rechargeable batteries over conventional<br/>
types as the docking station keeps the digital readers charged and in a safe location when<br/>
not being used. All connected and operating within alloy housing for strength in case<br/>
dopped or even driven over. On the outside of the alloy casing, you will find a spirit<br/>
level, two (2) magnetic bases, and a backlit display for initial setup. These Digital<br/>
Readers will have multiple uses due to the gyroscope/accelerometer. For example,<br/>
checking angles on frames are true and even square, the speed of objects when attache<br/>d
using the reader’s magnets, plus more</p>
<p>Each Digital reader will attach to a Wheel adapter bracket which attaches to the wheel<br/>
on the vehicle. Strong and sturdy alloy will be required to eliminate flex when in use as<br/>
this can cause incorrect readings. Steering Wheel Digital Reader will comprise of the<br/>
same components as the Digital Readers, which attaches to the Steering Wheel Bracket<br/>
made of the same materials as the wheel brackets. Swivel plates and hoists(etc.) are sold<br/>
separately as basic sets can be used to complete wheel alignment on most vehicle<br/>
Steering Lock and Stop/Brake Brace included as required for operational purposes<br/>
during a wheel alignment. Tablet has a special case to eliminate any damages to the tablet<br/>
if dropped. High specifications of tablet regarding CPU type, ram, storage, screen<br/>
resolution, plus more. The tablet will have Wi-Fi to connect to each Digital reader. </p>
<p>Custom GUI is user-friendly and intuitive mainly compiled using Python/C++. The tablet<br/>
can also connect to a local printer source (sold separately) to be able to print results.<br/>
Updates will be required from time to time and will come from the source home page and<br/>
be updated monthly. This can be accessed on the tablet if an internet connection is<br/>
available. Digital Readers will be able to show specific information and compare between each<br/>
digital reader, creating a 3D database on a supplied tablet.</p>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>Most of the equipment required is readily available. Sensors like Arduino and Raspberry<br/>
Pi are great choices when it comes to flexibility in adapting programs, though keeping to a<br/>
compact design and costs will be the key component in the project. Using tubular steel, mounting<br/>
brackets, and even spirit levels can complete the physical build of each device. Rechargeable<br/>
batteries with the device’s very own docking station would be favorable over generic batteries,<br/>
just to give all devices a more professional feel.</p>
<p>The software can be programmed using C++, or Python to create certain parameters<br/>
regarding specifications on certain makes/models of vehicles. Most of which can be stored on<br/>
any suitable iPad or tablet for that extra freedom or Mobility. Options to store data (saved work)<br/>
to a cloud service would be beneficial. This would require the use of Wi-Fi systems</p>

<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>Knowledge in using Arduino and Raspberry Pi products is required. Choosing the correct<br/>
sensors (axis) is important – a single card is more compact, though may not complete all tasks<br/>
required. Assembly and programming abilities are highly required as most specifications may<br/>
need to be added manually. Access to data can be sourced and licensed, though this will add to<br/>
costs.</p>
<p>Power tool safety and awareness is required for building housing units for the sensors.<br/>
Jigs/Rigs can be built to maintain consistency with every device manufactured. An<br/>
understanding of C++ and Python is highly regarded as creating a program that can be uploaded<br/>
into each device.</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>There is a demand for more convenient and cost-effective equipment. Wheel alignment<br/>
machines will always have a presence in most majority of automotive workshops throughout<br/>
Australia. This product will have a very large impact on the industry. The development of this<br/>
product has the potential to change the industry, whilst bringing forward more ideas from within<br/>
the field. Vehicles change, but how repairs are carried out has not.</p>
<p>With the original design in workshops being very large and fixed in place, valuable space<br/>
is taken, the solution to this is compact design along with mobility. Out in the field, there are<br/>
portable devices used to complete wheel alignment, though these can be clunky and, in some<br/>
cases, take up reality inside a van/truck. Welcome to the digital age! Lightweight sensors along<br/>
with an iPad/tablet can save space in vans/trucks along with all the features of a workshop.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>From personal information to project ideas – All involve some form of IT related aspect.<br/>
Knowing the automotive background, programming has become the topic of choice. Completing this<br/>
profile has certainly changed the thought processes from understanding how items operate to critically<br/>
thinking more ethically about outcomes, goals, and even personal interests</p>
