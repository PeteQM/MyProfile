<body>


<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to the profile of Peter McKendrick. In this space, we will dive into some
personal aspects: From a glimpse of his background and interests to the perspective of IT and
that perfect job. With new online profiling techniques, there is a greater understanding of the
personality, learning styles, and psychometrics that surround Peter.</p>
<p>A project at the end will demonstrate developed skills, experience, and knowledge in
the IT field. Showing first-hand how to anticipate outcomes and ‘thinking on your toes’ will truly
shine. Previous studies/experiences in the automotive world will also add to the twist.</p>
<p>Hi! My name is Peter McKendrick. My student ID is S3930703 and you can reach me on
s3930703@student.rmit.edu.au. I am Māori decent with 2 Brothers and 1 Sister (small family – I
know!). Very happily married to Melissa with 2 curious, but cheeky young boys.</p>
<p>After completing year 12, I went on to an apprenticeship in the Automotive Industry.
Most of the theory has been completed through Queensland TAFE. Working in large
workshops/corporations has many great benefits – for me, it was further training to become
Master Diagnostic Technician (highest level in auto trade). A few years later, I was allowed to
upskill to Dual Trade – Auto Electrician.</p>
<p>During my apprenticeship, I used to ride BMX professionally (Street and Halfpipe). In
one competition, which was my last, I had a very bad accident. Basically (read further if you
dare) my left leg was pointing in a direction it shouldn’t….. yup! I still ride to this day, though
just with the family and with NO extreme tricks.</p>
<p>I love IoT, Smart things, and Networking. Recently, I have been researching a lot into
programming and Raspberry Pi. During my studies in Auto Electrical, we had learned about
Gates – How they work and create operations using Gates. My first program was to turn a light
bulb on and off, using a series of transistors representing a CPU. I had such a big smile! My new
home (in the build process) is full of IoT, with its very own home lab. I am so excited to see it
finished</p>
<p>Everything starts with an idea on paper. Putting that idea into reality is how I made it to
RMIT. Requiring further studies for my career in IT (Idea), I had researched a lot of universities.
It was the testimonies on RMIT that caught my eye. Seeing the success of previous students and
the excitement of their learning has motivated me.</p>
<p>I have no experience in any university studies at all! What I expect from this, is to be
challenged and so uncomfortable - I have a very steep learning curve and strive under pressure.
It’s not just IT, but everything that university has. Essay’s, Assignments, Team/Group
presentations. All my training/study prior has been TAFE or in-class tests. To me, it’s not just IT.
It’s also the university.</p>

<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
<h2>Overview<h2><h3>The Portable Digital 3DWheel Alignment.</h3>
<p>There are many types of portable wheel alignment analogue/digital readers currently in
the market that utilize multiple devices that include a small display screen on each reader. Most
of these devices show only a few settings of adjustments and operate one by one. The Portable
Digital 3D Wheel Alignment will have each digital reader work in conjunction with each other
on a 3D landscape (X, Y and Z axis), whilst utilizing a tablet device to show many fields of
views for more superior control. An extra sensor situated on the steering wheel assists with
straight-ahead steering adjustments.</p>
<p>Ease to store countless information in i/pads, tablets, and even cloud services regarding
multiple makes, models, and procedures. The versatility of the digital readers was originally
aimed at racecars on track days, though expansion into local workshops can save owners tens of
thousands of dollars in equipment. On-the-go adjustments are very possible right in the owners’
driveway with a user-friendly GUI.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The Automotive Industry always looks to innovation, especially when it involves costs,
versatility, and availability. Wheel alignments are required in all fields in the Automotive
Industry. The average workshop 3D wheel alignment machine can cost up to $10,000. More
professional 3D wheel alignment machines can cost in excess of $45,000. Mobile mechanics
have to recommend other workshops that defeat the meaning of the Mobile Mechanic.</p>
<p>Attaching sensors to wheels will remain the same, the difference will be how the sensors
are read. Technology, mainly memory, has increased in capacity and decreased in size. Resulting
in a more compact, mobile, and more cost-effective device, compared to its bulkier predecessors.
Gyroscope, accelerometers, and compass sensors have also become compact and more affordable.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There are a few components involved with the Portable Digital 3D Wheel Alignment, and
within each Digital Reader, there are several components that make up a working Digital Reader.</p>
<p>• Digital Readers. Four (4) units – One (1) per wheel. Incl One (1) rechargeable
docking station. Extra digital readers are sold separately.</p>
<p>• Wheel Adapter Bracket. Four (4) units – One (1) per Digital Reader. Extras are
sold separately.</p>
<p>• Steering Wheel Digital Reader.</p>
<p>• Steering Wheel Adapter Bracket.</p>
<p>• Steering Wheel Lock</p>
<p>• Stop/Brake Pedal Brace</p>
<p>• Tablet Device – Includes charger, Wi-Fi capabilities, and installed GUI (plug and
play).</p>
<p>Each Digital Reader contains a Wi-Fi, Gyroscope, Accelerometer, and Compass
sensor which are all programable. Powered by rechargeable batteries over conventional
types as the docking station keeps the digital readers charged and in a safe location when
not being used. All connected and operating within alloy housing for strength in case
dopped or even driven over. On the outside of the alloy casing, you will find a spirit
level, two (2) magnetic bases, and a backlit display for initial setup. These Digital
Readers will have multiple uses due to the gyroscope/accelerometer. For example,
checking angles on frames are true and even square, the speed of objects when attached
using the reader’s magnets, plus more</p>
<p>Each Digital reader will attach to a Wheel adapter bracket which attaches to the wheel
on the vehicle. Strong and sturdy alloy will be required to eliminate flex when in use as
this can cause incorrect readings. Steering Wheel Digital Reader will comprise of the
same components as the Digital Readers, which attaches to the Steering Wheel Bracket
made of the same materials as the wheel brackets. Swivel plates and hoists(etc.) are sold
separately as basic sets can be used to complete wheel alignment on most vehicle
Steering Lock and Stop/Brake Brace included as required for operational purposes
during a wheel alignment. Tablet has a special case to eliminate any damages to the tablet
if dropped. High specifications of tablet regarding CPU type, ram, storage, screen
resolution, plus more. The tablet will have Wi-Fi to connect to each Digital reader. </p>
<p>Custom GUI is user-friendly and intuitive mainly compiled using Python/C++. The tablet
can also connect to a local printer source (sold separately) to be able to print results.
Updates will be required from time to time and will come from the source home page and
be updated monthly. This can be accessed on the tablet if an internet connection is
available. Digital Readers will be able to show specific information and compare between each
digital reader, creating a 3D database on a supplied tablet.</p>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>Most of the equipment required is readily available. Sensors like Arduino and Raspberry
Pi are great choices when it comes to flexibility in adapting programs, though keeping to a
compact design and costs will be the key component in the project. Using tubular steel, mounting
brackets, and even spirit levels can complete the physical build of each device. Rechargeable
batteries with the device’s very own docking station would be favorable over generic batteries,
just to give all devices a more professional feel.</p>
<p>The software can be programmed using C++, or Python to create certain parameters
regarding specifications on certain makes/models of vehicles. Most of which can be stored on
any suitable iPad or tablet for that extra freedom or Mobility. Options to store data (saved work)
to a cloud service would be beneficial. This would require the use of Wi-Fi systems</p>

<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>Knowledge in using Arduino and Raspberry Pi products is required. Choosing the correct
sensors (axis) is important – a single card is more compact, though may not complete all tasks
required. Assembly and programming abilities are highly required as most specifications may
need to be added manually. Access to data can be sourced and licensed, though this will add to
costs.</p>
<p>Power tool safety and awareness is required for building housing units for the sensors.
Jigs/Rigs can be built to maintain consistency with every device manufactured. An
understanding of C++ and Python is highly regarded as creating a program that can be uploaded
into each device.</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>There is a demand for more convenient and cost-effective equipment. Wheel alignment
machines will always have a presence in most majority of automotive workshops throughout
Australia. This product will have a very large impact on the industry. The development of this
product has the potential to change the industry, whilst bringing forward more ideas from within
the field. Vehicles change, but how repairs are carried out has not.</p>
<p>With the original design in workshops being very large and fixed in place, valuable space
is taken, the solution to this is compact design along with mobility. Out in the field, there are
portable devices used to complete wheel alignment, though these can be clunky and, in some
cases, take up reality inside a van/truck. Welcome to the digital age! Lightweight sensors along
with an iPad/tablet can save space in vans/trucks along with all the features of a workshop.</p>

Conclusion
<p>From personal information to project ideas – All involve some form of IT related aspect.
Knowing the automotive background, programming has become the topic of choice. Completing this
profile has certainly changed the thought processes from understanding how items operate to critically
thinking more ethically about outcomes, goals, and even personal interests</p>
